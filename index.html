    <h2><u>ðŸ§‰The Site-Seeing Is <strong class="che">AMAZING</strong>!ðŸ§‰</u></h2>
    <center><p id="arg-talk" style="font-size: larger;"> <b>There are so many wonderful places to visit during your trip here. From the country-sides of Tucuman, where 
        where you are met with beutiful mountians, and the weather is always beautiful and the air is light and clear. You also have Necochea, 
    and its beautiful beaches and shops. Patagonia is also known for its mountians, but they are icy and beautifully cold peaks and glaciers due to being in the southernest 
    parts of Argentina. Their waters are so clear due to no contamination or pollution! And Iguazu Falls is known as one
of the seven natural wonders of the world. It has a waterfall that so deep that when people try to dive there it is almost impossible, making it very dangerous. It is 
called "La Garganta Del Diablo", or, The Devil's Throat.</b></p></center>

    <h2><u>ðŸ§‰The People There Are <strong class="che">SO</strong> Nice!ðŸ§‰</u></h2>

<center><p id="arg-talk" style="font-size: larger;"> <b>The is such a gentle and humble way about many of the people in Argentina. When greeting, you are met with kisses and hugs,
    and a bright smile that makes you feel accepted and loved. Our family time is also something that we hold dear to our hearts 
    as Argentinians. We value quality-time, and after meals, we have something called a "sobremesa" which is when we stay at the table and talk even after the meal is done. We don't 
    automatically go to wash the dishes and clean the table. We take the time to just be at peace with each other before going on with our day. It is a lovely way to reconnect with 
    those we love! We are passionate about our sports, our cumbia and tango music, our food, and ourselves in our self care and style. We are a community of a country!

<h2><u>ðŸ§‰The <strong class="che">BEST</strong> Futbol Team In The World, Baby! (Not Up For Debate)ðŸ§‰</u></h2>

<center><p id="arg-talk" style="font-size: larger;"> <b>
    They are strong, focused, with one goal in mind: to make each other stronger and bring a win consistently. From Dibu, our incredible goaly; Julian Alvarez, who they call 
    "Arania"- Spiderman- for his dynamic play (He's so fricken FINE, plz search him up-but he's mine tho). He works in the front and back lines as a defender and offese to score many goals.
    And last but not least, we have Messi-The Flea. He has become so known for his humility, skill, and positivity in the soccer community. It makes us Argentinians so proud to have him represent us on 
    <i>and</i> off the field.

<h2><u>ðŸ§‰Don't Even Get Me  <strong class="che">STARTED</strong> On The Food There!ðŸ§‰</u></h2>

<center><p id="arg-talk" style="font-size: larger;"> <b>
    I'm not kidding when I say it is so good. Our breakfast usually consists of coffee with cream, and toasted sandwhiches, and faturas, which are pastries like sweet 
    crossants, or types of danishes. Our lunch is usually steak with french fries or fried eggs, milanesa (thin spanish chicken cutlets), and puree de papa (mashed potatoes).
    and after lunch, we have something at 4-5pm called la merienda, which is like a snacktime, where we also eat faturas, and drink Mate, our national drink. We also have sandwhiches de miga, which are sandwhiches with the crust cut off.
     For dinner (and we always eat between 8-10), we eat pasta, empanadas, pizza, and our famous Asasos-a spanish styled BBQ with steak and sausages like Chorizo. You literally can't go wrong with ANY of the food there!

    Overall, it is a privelige to even know the culture behind this country and its people. It is such a wonderful and beautiful place 
    (especially for the holidays- Its summer over there during Christmastime!!!) But it is the love of the people that makes it the place to be. 
    I hope that you find it as interesting as I do, and worthy of a trip. <br>
